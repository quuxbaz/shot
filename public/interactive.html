<h1>The Web2PDF API</h1>

Save websites to PDF or to a PNG image.

<h1>Briefly, what can this web service do for me?</h1> 

<ol> <li> /shot/image captures a full website producing a PNG image<li> /shot/pdf-a4paper embeds screenshot in an A4-sized PDF<li> /shot/pdf-print-a4paper converts HTML website to A4-sized PDF <li> /shot/pdf embeds full page screenshot of the website in a PDF (good for digital archiving) </ol>


<h1>Endpoint <tt>/shot/pdf-print-a4paper</tt>: multi-page PDF conversion of an HTML page</h1>

This is the same as using the print to PDF function of Google Chrome.
(Why Google Chrome?  It's the browser our API uses internally.)  It's
good for printing. (An A4-size PDF will be produced.)  If the PDF
doesn't perfectly match the way it looks on your browser, then you
have two options: (1) write CSS so that it looks the way you like; (2)
give up on CSS and go for a screenshot of the website.  If you go for
(2), see the rest of this page.

<h1>Endpoint <tt>/shot/pdf-a4paper</tt>: one-page screenshot of a website on a 1225 x 1750 viewport</h1>

The result is an A4-sized PDF with a screenshot of the website.  Only
the website visible on a viewport of 1225 x 1750 is captured.  Why 1225
x 1750?  Because the aspect ratio of this viewport is the same as that
of the A4 paper, which is 1/sqrt(2) =~ 1/1.4 = 0.7.  (This means the
screenshot will be scaled so as to fit properly into an A4 paper
without wasting space in the paper.)

<h1>Endpoint <tt>/shot/pdf</tt>: one-page screenshot of a full website</h1>

Save a one-page screenshot of a PDF that's good for digital archival.
This isn't good for printing because the PDF doesn't use A4 size.  It
uses a paper on the size of the website, which can have a long height
if the HTML page is long, but you can be sure it will capture the
whole thing.  (Users can still see what their printers can make of the
result.  Maybe they'll print it in a smart way.  This will depend on
the page too, certainly.)

<h1>How can put a print button on my website?</h1>
<p>Take a look at the source of this page and notice the URL in
 the <tt>a-href</tt> tags are url-encoded.  That's because symbols
 such as "://" or "%" cannot freely travel on a URL without affecting
 the meaning of the URL.  To avoid having to translate that always by
 hand, you can use the Javascript function
<tt>encodeURIComponent</tt> as in <a href="" id="link1"
target="_blank">this case</a> and <a href="" id="link2"
target="_blank">this case</a>.  Here's the relevant code:</p>

<xmp>
    <a href="" id="link1"
       target="_blank">View PDF version</a>

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"
            integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8="
            crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    <script> 
     var url = "https://varvy.com/pagespeed/wicked-fast.html";

     $(document).ready(function () { 
         $("#link1").attr("href", "/shot/pdf-a4paper/" + encodeURIComponent(url)); 
     }); 
    </script>
</xmp>

Having said that, notice that you can use the forms above to have the
translation done one time for you.  You only need to really use
Javascript if you, for some reason, build the URL dynamically on your
website.  In other words, if the URL of the target website doesn't
change, just paste it on the form above, click go an and copy the URL
once the PDF (or the image) is loaded on your browser.

<h1>How can I switch from portrait to landscape?</h1>

Append <tt>?layout=landscape</tt> to the URL of this PDF API, not to
the URL of the target website, that is, not to the URL of website will
be captured.  For instance, <a href="/shot/pdf-print-a4paper/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ysitedemo.com%2Fgoogle-calendar%2Feast-branch%2F?layout=portrait">portrait</a> and <a href="/shot/pdf-print-a4paper/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ysitedemo.com%2Fgoogle-calendar%2Feast-branch%2F?layout=landscape">landscape</a>.

<script> 
var url = "https://varvy.com/pagespeed/wicked-fast.html";

$(document).ready(function () { 
     $("#link1").attr("href", "/shot/image/" + encodeURIComponent(url)); 
     $("#link2").attr("href", "/shot/pdf-a4paper/" + encodeURIComponent(url)); 
}); 
</script>
